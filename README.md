# BCH
BCH
BCH codes are among the most powerful cyclic block codes and are widely used
in wireless applications. For any positive pair of integers m and t, there is a binary
(n, k) BCH code with the following parameters:

Block length: n = 2m – 1	
Number of check bits: n - k ≤ mt
Minimum distance: d min ≥ 2t + 1

This code can correct all combinations of t or fewer errors. The generator polynomial
for this code can be constructed from the factors of (X2m-1 + 1). The BCH
codes provide flexibility in the choice of parameters (block length, code rate).
